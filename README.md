[Pollfish] (http://www.pollfish.com) is new way of monetizing mobile apps that pays up to 20x more than classic ads. 

Pollfish is a survey platform that delivers surveys instead of ads through mobile apps. Integration of Pollfish SDK takes less than 2 minutes and requires only one line of code. No changes are needed in the UI of the app since everything is displayed as an overlay (see below), while users that respond to surveys, enter into draws and win prizes (happy users)!

Minimum revenue for each completed survey through an app is $0.30 and users never leave the app. If no survey is available, nothing is shown to the users, as if Pollfish was never integrated in the app. 

Since Pollfish addresses the market research marketplace, Pollfish surveys can be used along with any ad network you are already using in your app without any problem, just to bring extra revenue!
